    <p>After years of building products like Stratum without a formal design system, 84.51° recognized the need for a unified design language<FootnoteRef id="meridian-description" />. 
      This was the beginning of Meridian, a comprehensive design system that would ensure consistency, accessibility, and scalability across all our products.</p>
    <p>As the Design Systems Lead, I was responsible for establishing the foundational principles, component library, documentation, and governance processes that would enable our teams to build better products faster.</p>
    <p>This project represents a significant evolution in how we approach design at 84.51°, moving from ad-hoc solutions to a systematic, scalable approach that benefits both our designers and the millions of users who interact with our products.</p>
