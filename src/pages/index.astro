		<p>Hey there, I’m Andrew—husband, dad, trail runner, designer. Currently building analytics platforms and leading design systems at 84.51° by day, while exploring the intersection of crypto indexes at Alongside by night.
			I haven’t won awards, but I’ve shipped digital products used by thousands, scaled design systems and helped build brands over the past decade.
			Working with great people fuels me, and I’m here to leave the world better than I found it.</p>
