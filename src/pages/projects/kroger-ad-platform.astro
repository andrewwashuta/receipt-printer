        Entry point for the Kroger Ad Platform, designed in collaboration with <a href="https://richgustke.design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rich Gustke</a>—the starting point for the offsite experience that I've been building.
        We've shifted the navigation globally to the sidebar, allowing for key content to use more screen real estate

  <section id="overview">
    <div class="section-header">
      <h2 class="section-heading"><span>Overview</span></h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      For over two years while on the <a href="/projects/meridian">Meridian</a> design systems team, I collaborated extensively with the Media experience design team, helping establish consistent UI patterns, streamlining complex ad workflows,
       and ensuring cohesive component usage across their platforms. This deep partnership gave me intimate knowledge of advertiser needs, pain points, as well as challenges the team faced. 
    </p>
    <p>   
       In early 2025, after a large reorganization at 84.51°, I was transferred to officially lead design on the Kroger Ad Platform, one of Kroger Precision Marketing's<FootnoteRef id="kpm" /> driving businesses. 
       With <strong>91% of campaigns improving sales</strong> and achieving <strong>5.1x higher average sales</strong><FootnoteRef id="sales-improvement" />, Kroger Ad Platform provides brands with access to Kroger's vast audience data and targeting capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the past six months, my team of incredible engineers and I have been working hard to deliver a self-serve ad platform for Kroger's offsite advertising by Q4. In the words of one of my engineers,
        “Andrew is the only design guy I've worked with who will throw me a coding playground link and actually debug and solve my front-end questions. He is in the trenches with engineers to solve issues for Offsite.” But what exactly is offsite advertising?

    <p>
        Imagine a customer wants to run an ad on one of Meta's platforms, Instagram, for example—those ads you might see as you're scrolling through your feed or watching stories. 
        They come to us because they want audience data from Kroger shoppers, and our offsite experience allows them to do that; they 
        can input all the details relating to the ad, create custom audiences, and then connect to their Meta account so that fresh audience data flows through. In the above example,
        Kodiak Cakes can leverage Kroger's shopper and audience data, and drive back to their own site or a Kroger entity, depending on the goal of the campaign.

        The current offsite experience is a Microsoft Form, heavily prone to human error
</ProjectMedia>
<p>
    So, why are we building this? Well, the answer is simple—today's offsite experience is a Microsoft Form; yes, you heard that right. We've received tons of feedback from our customers, 
    partners and internal stakeholders that it's too manual, prone to human error, and requires a lot of back and forth. If you make an error while filling it out, what follows
    is an email chain with often futile attempts to remedy the issue. 84.51° media buyers have to manually build audiences in the platform according to specs laid 
    out in the form, context switching constantly, another opportunity for error; it's just not sustainable.

      Within the Kroger Ad Platform, there are two distinct experiences: onsite and offsite campaign management.
  </p>
  <p>Onsite<FootnoteRef id="onsite-explainer" /> campaigns came first in the platform, centered around complex campaign building and measurement workflows. 
      Campaigns are structured through ad groups and require ongoing control and measurement. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Offsite activations take a slightly different approach. These are streamlined, one-off activations that transfer Kroger audiences to external 
      platforms for media buyers to leverage. 
  </p>
  <p>While offsite activations are marginally simpler, there are shared similarities with the onsite experience. It creates opportunities to reuse familiar patterns, while also providing a feedback loop for learning 
      continuously from users across both experiences.

    The brand new offsite intake experience, featuring a streamlined, intuitive flow—it's a breeze to use; accessible and keyboard-navigable
</ProjectMedia>
    <p>
       In our latest production build for the offsite intake experience, we've directly addressed the <a href="#friction">pain points</a> advertisers expressed. The new flow centers around a single, scrollable page 
        that maintains context, with sub-steps being surfaced through focused modals. Also, you might notice me tabbing through fields; it's fast, accessible (thanks to <a href="/projects/meridian">Meridian</a> components), and a lot more efficient—just imagine
        if those panels were separate pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Critical actions are now thoughtfully located at the top of content overlays, keeping them within the natural line of sight. Form field validation has been designed to be a lot more forgiving—there's validation built into fields 
        (e.g. numeric requirements), but if a user decides to skip a field, they're not immediately plagued with errors. We leverage Vest, a robust form validation framework, to handle checks across the board.
         Most requirements are instead parsed on submission, and the user is provided with a clear actionable error message, if any issues arise.

    Sub-steps like product selection are now surfaced in a modal, helping to maintain context. The user can easily return to the main creation flow, with or without their selections. We're currently working
    on an improved product selection experience
    </ProjectMedia>
      <p>
        Context is wildly important, “This is a lot more like what I'm used to with other platforms. [I] especially like that I don't have to be jumping around pages,” one advertiser said.
        Product selection is a great example of this. Instead of being brought to a new page (as it is in the current onsite flow), the user can retain the same context while selecting products. 
        It's a lot more efficient, and a lot more intuitive.

      <p>
        Now, imagine each of the above panels living on a separate page; it equates to a lot of context switching, causing a significant amount of fatigue and frustration.
        Not to mention, it's inherently slower and inefficient. With the new continuous scroll experience, as we've deemed it, your content is immediately 
        available, and you can jump between sections and steps with ease; auto-save keeps your progress along the way.

    <p>
      The transformation above represents months of iteration based on advertiser feedback. 
      To appreciate why each design decision matters, let's dive into the experience and friction points that were frustrating advertisers on a daily basis:
    </p>

        Onsite ad group creation experience in the Kroger Ad Platform, featuring a heavily segmented workflow in a <a href="/projects/meridian">Meridian</a> content overlay. While I was a member on the
        Meridian team, we worked closely with the Kroger Ad Platform team to build this experience composably—and got a ton of feedback in the process from our partners
</ProjectMedia>
    <p>
        There's a couple of key issues with the above experience, highlighted in blue.
    </p>
    <p> (a) Empty fields trigger validation errors immediately <code>onblur</code>, before the user has a chance to enter data. This is
        jarring, especially as a person is tabbing through fields, making them feel like they've done something wrong before submission. 
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) This flow is extremely complex, with six to seven steps, and up to three
        layers deep in some cases. “Jumping around all over the place is very inefficient and not practical,” one advertiser said. 
    </p>
    <p>
        (c) The locations of the actions are not intuitive and cause the eye to bounce around
        the page; important actions are fixed to the bottom of the page, out of line of sight. There's repetitiveness in functionality as well, where <strong>close</strong> and <strong>✕</strong> perform the same action.
        <strong>Continue</strong> progresses you to the next step, but ultimately changes if you're on the last step. It's a lot of cognitive load.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some users potentially filling out 20+ ad groups a day spread across multiple campaigns; clarity, continuity and context are immensely important.

    </span>
</ProjectMedia>
    <p>
        Advertisers complained about jumping around too many pages, with too many clicks and repetitive steps. They also had trouble establishing their location. The content overlay has functionality to facilitate 
        several layers deep of sub-flows, but switching context is challenging. In the above example, when the user drills into the product selection step to add products, they're brought
        to what appears to be a new page, when really it's just another layer in the content overlay. Often times, there would be abandonment because of this fatigue.

    <p>
        Audience building<FootnoteRef id="audience-segment" /> is a key component of the offsite experience. It's the foundation of our activations; at the end of the day, buyers just want the audience and targeting data
        to be ported over to the external platform of their choosing.

    <p>
      The new audience builder transforms segment creation into a more focused process. By isolating the creation in a modal, users can concentrate on one decision at a time without distractions. 
      Clear visual hierarchy, simplified language, and logical grouping of related options reduce cognitive load and make the relationships between choices immediately apparent.

<p>
  The segment creation process now unfolds more seamlessly within a modal, maintaining
  context throughout the process. Even when users dive deeper into product selection, which technically opens a second modal layer, they still have preserved their place in the activation
  creation flow. This eliminates the disorienting navigation jumps that previously left users wondering where they were in the process, as you'll see below.

    Previous onsite audience building experience; a layered content overlay with no hierarchy or structure to the process, that frequently left users disoriented
</ProjectMedia>
    <p>
        Previously, when a user opened the <strong>Create Segment</strong> process from the segmented intake flow, they're greeted with 
        another <strong>✕</strong> in the top left, signaling the second layer of depth in the content overlay. This contributes to the confusion we've observed with nested overlays (see <a href="#friction">Friction</a>).
        When users need to add products, they dive deeper into a third layer. 
      </p>
    <p>
        The real usability challenge emerges in the segment type configuration. The original experience presents users with a dense, overwhelming form
        where every option competes for attention. Headers, text, and inputs all blend together without clear, visual hierarchy. This creates significant cognitive load, as users try to parse 
        how different selections interact with each other.

<p>
    This new approach to building segments, and therefore audiences, demonstrates how thoughtful design and information architecture can transform a complex workflow into an intuitive experience.
    Like product selection above, by containing the entire process in a modular, contextual modal, users maintain their mental model throughout the activation build process.<FootnoteRef id="activation-backdrop" />

    A concept showcasing audience health, metrics, smart insights and recommendations that live in a panel alongside the segment builder
</ProjectMedia>
<p>
  So, what's next for audiences? We're working on a process to smartly surface audience metrics while buyers are in the build process. There will be quick-sizing, that'll give a person access to on-the-fly recommendations and a health score. 
  This will help buyers build better audiences, faster.
</p>
<p>
  The intelligent audience assistant provides real-time guidance as advertisers make targeting choices. If an audience is too narrow, it will make relevant suggestions to expand reach. 
  The health scoring algorithm considers audience size, historical performance of similar segments, and competitive saturation.
</p>
<p>
  This transforms audience building from guesswork into a guided, data-driven process. Advertisers (will hopefully) spend less time iterating and more time optimizing activations, 
  while Kroger's shopper insights ensure recommendations are grounded in actual purchase behavior backed by 84.51° data science.

    <p>
      I spoke earlier about the difference beteween onsite and offsite media in <a href="#intake-reimagined">Intake Reimagined</a>.
      Currently, there's little overlap between buyers who are operating in both. In the same breath, our audience data
      is a powerful asset to drive offsite media success. So, when a user has access to <strong>only</strong> Kroger's onsite
      media platform, and attempts to access the offsite experience, they're presented with the hook above; a motion exploration
      leveraging Krojis, a core part of Kroger's brand.
