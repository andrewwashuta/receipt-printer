  <p>My portfolio is the result of countless hours spent in <a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a>, with a teensy bit of work in <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, and a little help from <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Claude</a> along the way. There's nothing like designing in code, and building this site from scratch allowed me to fall back in love with the process. It's not perfect, but it's mine.</p>
  
  <p>The type is set in <a href="https://mnkytype.com/banana-grotesk">MNKY Banana Grotesk</a> from Monkey Type—I like the way the <strong>a</strong> leans slightly left. I'm also using <a href="https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-io/">MD IO</a> from Mass Driver for code snippets; Rutherford Craze is a master of type.</p>
  
  <p>On the technical side, I built this with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>—on recommendation from my good friend, <a href="https://loganliffick.com/">Logan Liffick</a>. It's furnished with <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> for styling and deployed on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. No Tailwind here, but maybe someday.</p>
  
  <p>I'd be remiss if I didn't say this is very much a work in progress. I'm always looking for ways to improve; feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@andrew.cv">drop me feedback</a>.</p>

  <p>Genuinely, thanks for stopping by.</p>
