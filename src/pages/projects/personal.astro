    <p>Annual holiday card designs have become a tradition, allowing me to experiment with different design styles, illustration, and printing techniques.
      Every year, I've challenged myself to try something new for our family's holiday card. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Around 2019, you'll see the size of the card decrease, as we've tried to do our part to reduce paper waste over the years. We also transitioned from sending
        cards in sealed envelopes, to simply sending a postcard. In the same breath, we've digitized the yearly update we send with the card, and provide a QR code or 
        a link to the digital version.<FootnoteRef id="accessibility" />

        2024 — My wife miscarried and we lost our daughter in the process in 2024. This was a difficult year, for many reasons, and all I could think about was this little angel up in Heaven,

    I'm honestly super proud of these—they're very much a labor of love, and a collaborative effort with my wife, who I have affectionately dubbed the <strong>art director</strong>.
    Here's to another year and another holiday card on the horizon!

  <section id="Star Wars">
    <div class="section-header">
      <h2 class="section-heading"><span>Star Wars</span></h2>
      <small class="label">Galactic Concepts</small>
    </div>
    <p>
      I'm really just a nerd at heart. At this point in time, I've watched every piece of Star Wars content that exists—live-action or animated, I don't differentiate. Talk to me any day about The Bad Batch,
      Visions, or Andor, and I'll happily oblige.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been equally obsessed about all the intricate details that go into the <a href="https://www.blindltd.com/andor" target="_blank">UI and visual effects</a> of the live-action Star Wars universe. 
      It's so inventive, and I'm always left in awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I set out to create my own take on the electrobinoculars from Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back, as an homage to the original trilogy.
    </p>
    <ProjectMedia
      src={personalMedia.electrobinoculars.image}
      alt="A macro shot through a pair of binoculars on Hoth, as AT-ATs are seen approaching in the distance"
      mediaType="image"
      showCaption={true}
    >
      <span>
        My exploratory UI for the viewfinder of the electrobinoculars on Hoth, featuring custom UI, nixie numerals, and texturing
      </span>
    </ProjectMedia>
    <p>
      This is a piece that comes alive for me. It feels like I'm right there on Hoth, next to the rebels. My process was scrappy: I borrowed an image of the AT-ATs from the movie, 
      and then created the surrounding ephemeral UI and texturing. There's something about it I love; the visual symmetry, the grain; it's nostalgic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The numerals you see at the bottom are actually my take on the numerals from Luke's targeting computer. I did a ton of research, because I was curious how they were created
      and couldn't find any definitive typeface, and learned that they were in fact, nixie tubes<FootnoteRef id="nixie" />. For the films, they would light up each number in sequence 
      and photograph each frame to create the appearance of a countdown.
    </p>
    <ProjectMedia
      src={personalMedia.nixie.image}
      alt="A sequence of numbers 1 through 9 in the style of nixie tubes"
      mediaType="image"
      showCaption={true}
    >
      <span>
        Custom nixie numerals from Luke Skywalker's targeting computer. I made this into a font for future use
      </span>
    </ProjectMedia>
    <p>
      I knew I wanted to build more exploratory UI, so I reached out to a pilot-friend of mine, who was kind enough to snap some pictures the next
      time he was in the cockpit. What came of that research into different displays in modern planes was this flyby of the Death Star:
    </p>

      <ProjectMedia
        src={personalMedia.flyby.image}
        alt="A flyby of the Death Star, featuring custom UI"
        mediaType="image"
        showCaption={true}
      >
        <span>
          A flyby of the Death Star, featuring a custom backdrop, UI, and texturing. Rendered in After Effects and composited in Photoshop
        </span>
      </ProjectMedia>
<p>
  This is a perfect example of my versatility as a designer. The backdrop of the Death Star, tie fighters, and space, were all generated in 
  After Effects. I leveraged some 3D object files as a base, but heavily translated them into a particle system. The result is a tesselated Death Star, 
  fully capable of being animated three-dimensionally, with custom UI spatially overlaid. Remember that nixie tube font? I put that to good use, as well.
</p>
<p>
  This is truly the type of stuff that fuels me creatively as a designer. I'm not sure if I'll ever get the opportunity to work on UI for a Star Wars film, 
  but in the words of Han Solo, “Never tell me the odds.”
