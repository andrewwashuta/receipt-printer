    <p>Kroger was in the process of sunsetting their legacy analytics platform in 2017, and brought the build of the new platform in-house at 84.51°<FootnoteRef id="8451-description" />. 
      This was the beginning of what would eventually become Stratum, a robust analytics platform that has gone on to generate <strong>$1B+ in contracts</strong> for Kroger,
      and surface over <strong>3.8M+ reports</strong> for 84.51°'s CPG partners.<FootnoteRef id="reports-count" /></p>
    <p>Until 2021, I had the pleasure of leading the design of Stratum, along a myriad of incredible people. 
      I was the lead UI designer, but equally responsible for discovery research, design systems (at a time when we didn't have one!), and visual
      design. It was truly a balancing act of parity and innovation—we had to meet existing needs of our users, while building with a forward-thinking mindset. </p>
    <p>It took months of vision workshops and hundreds of hours of research to align on what we were building, at a company that truly had not built bespoke products before.
      Despite the challenges, I'm deeply proud of what Stratum became over the course of its first four years. Let me start by showing the latest exploratory work on Stratum AI—before diving into the full journey of how we got there.</p>

    </div>
    <p>It's 2024, amidst the most recent AI boom. As a member of our design systems team at the time, I designed a proof-of-concept for a text-based AI command prompt,
       integrated neatly within Stratum to help users quickly take action on reports. This was a perfect opportunity to experiment with our design system, and revisit my work from three years prior. I mean, how cool would it be to be able to generate micro-reports and -dashboards based on simple commands?</p>
    <p>I firmly believe in the power of storytelling, so this was a quick build done entirely in Figma<FootnoteRef id="figma-prototype" /> to demonstrate how our Meridian Design System might be used experimentally to 
      craft a fast, engaging experience for people using our products.</p>

    <p>Over many years of researching and building Stratum, it had become evident how important it was to bring focus to workflows as much as possible. Striking a balance between
      progressive disclosure and context—filters should never get in the way of reporting. But, at the end of the day, that context is equally important when cycling through hundreds of reports a day.

        Quick launcher enables users to rapidly access reports, dashboards and perform actions—all through an intuitive, fast, AI-driven CLI
      </span>
    </ProjectMedia>
    <p>Through years of feedback loops, we had learned that users were overwhelmed by the volume of reports, as well as the ability to quickly navigate between them. As such, you can imagine how many one-off, throwaway 
      reports were generated and saved, and how many were never used again.
    </p>
    <p>The quick launcher concept allows users to quickly run micro-reports through a short command, or spin off agents to create new ones, greatly reducing the volume of saved, one-off reports.</p>
