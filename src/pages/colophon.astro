  <p>My portfolio is the result of countless hours spent in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> and <a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a>, with a teensy bit of work in <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>. Truly though, there's nothing like designing in code—building this site from scratch allowed me to fall back in love with the process. It's not perfect, but it's mine.</p>
  
  <p>The type is set in <a href="https://mnkytype.com/banana-grotesk">MNKY Banana Grotesk</a> from Monkey Type—I really like the way the <strong>a</strong> sort of leans into the other glyphs.</p>
  
  <p>On the technical side, I built this with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>—on recommendation from my good friend, <a href="https://loganliffick.com/">Logan Liffick</a>. It's furnished with <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> for styling and deployed on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Genuinely, thanks for stopping by.</p>
