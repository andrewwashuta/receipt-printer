    <p>Kroger was in the process of sunsetting their legacy analytics platform in 2017, and brought the build of the new platform in-house at 84.51°<FootnoteRef id="8451-description" />. 
      This was the beginning of what would eventually become Stratum, a robust analytics platform that has helped customers build millions of reports, and grown as a significant revenue driver for Kroger.</p>

    <p>From 2017 to 2021, I had the pleasure of leading the design of Stratum, along a myriad of incredible people. 
      I began as a senior UI designer, but quickly upskilled to a lead, equally responsible for discovery research, design systems (at a time when we didn't have one!), and visual
      design. It was truly a balancing act of parity and innovation—we had to meet existing needs of our users, while building with a forward-thinking mindset. </p>
    <p>It took months of vision workshops and hundreds of hours of research to align on what we were building, at a company that truly had not built bespoke products before.
      Despite the challenges, I'm deeply proud of what Stratum became over the course of its first four years. Let me start by showing the latest exploratory work I did on Stratum AI—before diving into the full journey of how we got there.</p>

    <p>It's 2024, amidst the most recent AI boom. As a member of our systems team, <a href="/projects/meridian">Meridian</a>, at the time, I designed a proof-of-concept for a text-based AI command prompt,
       integrated neatly within Stratum to help users quickly take action on reports. This was a perfect opportunity to experiment with our design system, and revisit my work from three years prior. I mean, how cool would it be to be able to generate micro-reports and -dashboards based on simple commands?</p>
    <p>I firmly believe in the power of storytelling, so this was a quick build done entirely in Figma<FootnoteRef id="figma-prototype" /> to demonstrate how our <a href="/projects/meridian">Meridian Design System</a> might be used experimentally to 
      craft a fast, engaging experience for people using our products.</p>

    <p>At its core, Stratum is a reporting and analytics platform. Over many years of researching and building Stratum, it had become evident how important it was to bring focus to workflows as much as possible; for example, striking a balance between
      progressive disclosure and context—navigation and filters should never get in the way of viewing reports. But, at the end of the day, that context is equally important when cycling through hundreds of reports a day.

              Quick launcher enables users to rapidly access reports, dashboards and perform actions—all through an intuitive, fast, AI-driven CLI
    </ProjectMedia>
    <p>Through years of feedback loops, we had learned that users were overwhelmed by the volume of reports, as well as the ability to quickly navigate between them. As such, you can imagine how many one-off, throwaway 
      reports were generated and saved, and how many were never used again.
    </p>
    <p>The quick launcher concept allows users to quickly run micro-reports through a short command, or spin off agents to create new ones, greatly reducing the volume of saved, one-off reports.</p>

              Displaying a micro-report generated by AI within the quick launcher
    </ProjectMedia>
    <p>In the same breath, I wanted to make actions a breeze within the quick launcher. Sharing a report becomes as simple as <code>⌘K</code> → <code>S</code>, while creating a new report becomes as simple as <code>⌘K</code> → <code>N</code>.
    It's a way for users to build muscle memory, while maintaining a high level of accessibility.</p>

              Actions like sharing a report with a colleague are effortless, and entirely keyboard-navigable
    </ProjectMedia>
    <p>
      There's plenty of room for improvement. For example, when selecting a peer to share a report with, 
      there are often cases where reports are shared with multiple people. There would likely need to be a way to select multiple people, or groups of people, before firing off the action.
      But, if I'm only sharing with a couple people, you could quickly iterate through the list and send; it all depends on the use case.

        Using layered conditional statements within Figma, the chart visualization responds accordingly based on dataset selection
    </ProjectMedia>
    <p>
      Throughout the early years of Stratum's existence, we had heard feedback that there's simply too much noise when it comes to data visualization, especially if you have 10 or more datasets in one chart.
      In the above example, I leveraged conditional statements to thoughtfully introduce color to the area. If one dimension is selected, the area is shown accordingly, while the other line is dimmed.
      However, if two or more are selected, it actually hides the area for both, to prevent potentially unattractive overlap, and keeps both lines visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This exploration brought me full circle to reflect on Stratum's journey—from its early challenges with data visualization noise to becoming a sophisticated analytics platform
      with tons of depth. It also served as inspiration for broader AI initiatives across the company. It's worth taking a step back to see how Stratum began and the 
      foundational design decisions that shaped its path to serving reports referencing 62M+ households worth of Kroger data and generating over $1B in client contracts.
