    <h2 class="project-heading"><span>Overview</span></h2>
    <p>Kroger was in the process of sunsetting their legacy analytics platform in 2017, and decided to bring the build of the new platform in-house. 
      This was the beginning of what would eventually become Stratum, a robust analytics platform that would go on to generate $1B+ in contracts for Kroger,
      and surface over 3.8M+ reports for our CPG partners.<a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></p>
    <p>Until 2021, I had the pleasure of leading design of Kroger's flagship analytics platform, Stratum, along a myriad of incredible people. 
      I was the lead UI designer, but equally responsible for discovery research, design systems (at a time when we didn't have one!), and the overall
      design approach.</p>
    <p>I'll be honest with you; I didn't know a thing about what it meant to build a product.</p>

    <h2 class="project-heading"><span>Stratum AI: Proof of Concept</span></h2>
    <p>It's 2024, and everyone is talking about AI. I designed a proof-of-concept for a text- and voice-based AI, integrated neatly within Stratum to help users better navigate and take action on reports.<a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2" class="footnote-ref">[2]</a></p>
    <p>I firmly believe in the power of storytelling, so this was a quick build to demonstrate how our Meridian Design System might be used to create a more engaging and intuitive experience.</p>
