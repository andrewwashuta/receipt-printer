    <p>It's 2024, and everyone is talking about AI. I designed a proof-of-concept for a text- and voice-based AI, integrated neatly within Stratum to help users better navigate and take action on reports.</p>
    <p>I firmly believe in the power of storytelling, so this was a quick build to demonstrate how our Meridian Design System might be used to create a more engaging and intuitive experience.</p>
