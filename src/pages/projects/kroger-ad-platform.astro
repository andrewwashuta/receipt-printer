    <p>
        Advertising is valuable. Coming from the insights side of the business, I never realized how much advertisers spend targeting shoppers.<FootnoteRef id="data-disclosure" />
        In early 2025, after a large reorganization at 84.51°, I was transferred over to lead design on the Kroger Ad Platform, one of Kroger Precision Marketing's<FootnoteRef id="kpm" /> driving businesses. With <strong>91% of campaigns 
        improving sales</strong> and achieving <strong>5.1x higher average sales</strong><FootnoteRef id="sales-improvement" />, Kroger Ad Platform provides brands with access to Kroger's vast audience data and targeting capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the past 5 months, my team of incredible engineers and I have been working hard to deliver a self-serve ad platform for Kroger's offsite advertising by Q4. But what exactly is offsite advertising?

    <p>
        Imagine a customer comes to us, and they want to run an ad on one of Meta's platforms, Instagram, for example—those ads you might see as you're scrolling through your feed or watching stories. 
        They come to us because they want audience data from Kroger shoppers, and our offsite experience allows them to do that; they 
        can input all the details relating to the ad, create custom audiences, and then connect to their Meta account so that fresh audience data flows through. In the above example,
        Kodiak Cakes can leverage Kroger's shopper and audience data, and drive back to their own site or a Kroger entity, depending on the goal of the campaign.

</ProjectMedia>
<p>
    So, why are we building this? Well, the answer is simple—today's offsite experience is a Microsoft Form. We've received tons of feedback from our customers, 
    partners and internal stakeholders that it's too manual, prone to human error, and requires a lot of back and forth. If you make an error while filling it out, what follows
    is an email chain with often futile attempts to remedy the issue. 84.51° media buyers have to manually build audiences in the platform according to specs laid 
    out in the form, context switching consistently, another opportunity for error; it's just not sustainable.

      <small class="label">Current onsite pain points</small>
    </div>
    <p>
        Within the Kroger Ad Platform, there are two distinct experiences: onsite and offsite campaigns.
    </p>
    <p>Onsite<FootnoteRef id="onsite-explainer" /> campaigns came first in the platform, centered around complex campaign building and measurement workflows. 
        Campaigns are structured through ad groups and require ongoing control and measurement. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Offsite activations, take a slightly different approach. These are streamlined, one-off activations that transfer Kroger audiences to external 
        platforms for media buyers to leverage. 
    </p>
    <p>While offsite activations are structurally simpler, there are shared similarities with the onsite experience, namely creating an activation loosely
        resembles the ad group creation flow. It creates opportunities to reuse familiar patterns, while also providing a feedback loop for learning 
        continuously from users across both experiences.

    </span>
</ProjectMedia>
    <p>
        There's a couple of key issues with the above experience, highlighted in blue. (a) Empty fields trigger validation errors immediately <code>onblur</code>, before the user has a chance to enter data. This is
        jarring, especially as a person is tabbing through fields, making them feel like they've done something wrong before submission. (b) This flow is extremely complex, with six to seven steps, and up to three
        layers deep in some cases. “Jumping around all over the place is very inefficient and not practical,” one advertiser said. (c) The locations of the actions are not intuitive and cause the eye to bounce around
        the page; important actions are fixed to the bottom of the page, out of line of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some users potentially filling out 20+ ad groups a day spread across multiple campaigns; clarity, continuity and context are immensely important.

    </span>
</ProjectMedia>
    <p>
        Advertisers complained about jumping around too many pages, with too many clicks and repetitive steps. They also had trouble establishing their location. The content overlay has functionality to facilitate 
        several layers deep of sub-flows, but switching contexts is really, really hard. In the above example, when the user drills into the product selection step to add products, they're brought
        to what appears to be a new page, when really it's just another layer in the content overlay. Often times, there would be abandonment because of this fatigue.

    The brand new offsite intake experience, featuring a streamlined, intuitive flow—it's a breeze to use
  </span>
</ProjectMedia>
    <p>
       In our latest production build for the offsite intake experience, we've directly addressed the pain points advertisers expressed. The new flow centers around intuitive design principles: a single, scrollable page 
        that maintains context, while sub-steps are surfaced through focused modals. Also, you might notice me tabbing through fields; it's fast, accessible (thanks to Meridian components), and a lot more efficient—just imagine
        if those panels were separate pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Critical actions are now thoughtfully located at the top of content overlays, keeping them within the natural line of sight. Form field validation has been designed to be a lot more forgiving—there's validation built into fields 
        (e.g. numeric requirements), but if a user decides to skip a field, they're not immediately plagued with errors. Requirements are instead parsed on submission, and the user is provided with a clear actionable message if any issues arise.

    <span>Sub-steps like product selection are now surfaced in a modal, helping to maintain context. The user can easily return to the main creation flow, with or without their selections</span>
    </ProjectMedia>
      <p>
        Context is wildly important, “This is a lot more like what I'm used to with other platforms. [I] especially like that I don't have to be jumping around pages,” one advertiser said.
        Product selection is a great example of this. Instead of being brought to a new page (as it is in the current onsite flow), the user can retain the same context while selecting products. 
        It's a lot more efficient, and a lot more intuitive.

  <section id="audience">

      </div>
    <p>
        Audience building is a key component of the offsite experience. It's the foundation of the activation; at the end of the day, buyers just want the audience and targeting data
        to be ported over to the external platform of their choosing, whether that's Meta, Yahoo, The Trade Desk, or another platform.

  <span>
    Current onsite audience building experience; with no hierarchy or structure to the content
  </span>
</ProjectMedia>
    <p>
        Currently, audience building<FootnoteRef id="audience-segment" /> exists as a step in the ad group creation flow—the base level of the content overlay. Right away, when a user opens the <strong>Create Segment</strong> process, they're greeted with 
        another <strong>✕</strong> in the top left, signaling the second layer of depth in the content overlay. This contributes to the confusion we've observed with nested overlays (see <a href="#friction">Friction</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        When users need to add products, they dive deeper into a third layer. But, the real usability challenge emerges in the segment configuration itself. The original design presents users with a dense, overwhelming form
        where every option competes for attention. Headers, text, and inputs all blend together without clear, visual hierarchy. This creates significant cognitive load, as users try to parse 
        how different selections interact with each other.

    After: A streamlined modal that guides users through segment creation with clearer hierarchy and reduced cognitive load
</span>
</ProjectMedia>
<p>
    The redesigned experience transforms segment creation into a focused process. By isolating the creation in a modal, users can concentrate on one decision at a time without distractions. 
    Clear visual hierarchy, simplified language, and logical grouping of related options reduce cognitive load and make the relationships between choices immediately apparent.
</p>
<p>
    While this improved UI solves usability issues we identified, it's still only one piece of the puzzle. The segment creation process now unfolds seamlessly within a modal, maintaining
    context throughout the process. Even when users dive deeper into product selection, which technically opens a second modal layer, they still have preserved their place in the activation
    creation flow. This eliminates the disorienting navigation jumps that left users wondering where they were in the process.

<p>
    This new approach to building segments, and therefore audiences, demonstrates how thoughtful design and information architecture can transform a complex workflow into an intuitive experience.
    Like product selection above, by containing the entire process in a modular, contextual modal, users maintain their mental model throughout the activation build process.<FootnoteRef id="activation-backdrop" />
