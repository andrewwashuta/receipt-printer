      <h2 class="section-heading"><span>Overview</span></h2>
    </div>
    <p>After years of building products like <a href="/projects/stratum">Stratum</a> and its predecessors without a formal design system, 84.51° recognized the need for a unified design language in 2019. 
      This was the beginning of Meridian, the fabric of 84.51° products, a design system that would ensure cohesiveness, accessibility, and scalability across the entire ecosystem—both for designers and engineers alike.</p>
    <p>I reached out to my good friend and collaborator, <a href="https://richgustke.design">Rich Gustke</a>, in the hopes he would join 84.51° and help steward Meridian.
      As the system began to grow, I joined the team in early 2021, continuing to collaborate with Rich and our many developers. 
      <p>I was responsible for upkeep of the Figma component library, creation of new components, system documentation, processes and measurement that would enable our teams to build better products faster.</p>
    <p>My biggest surprise? Over time, I fell in love with mentorship. I worked closely with many of our co-ops and interns, several of which would go on to become full-time designers at 84.51°<FootnoteRef id="mentorship" />. I found that I love sharing knowledge and fostering young designers' growth and learning.</p>
    <p>I'm insanely proud of the work we accomplished over four years: we instantiated countless new components and enhancements, shifted to a neater UI implementation approach with Svelte, and massively improved the MDS<FootnoteRef id="mds" /> Figma design system; the list goes on.</p>
    <p>And while the (incredible) Meridian team was formally disbanded in early 2025, the system still receives contributions and updates from various teams today.
      With our components, we <strong>saved roughly 6.1 engineers' worth of time</strong> in 2024 alone—that's not even counting the time saved by our Figma design system!</p>

    </div>
    <p>I'll admit it, I'm obsessed with Figma. I'm passionate about making life easier for both designers and developers alike, and keeping the Figma design system consistent and up-to-date with code is a big part of that. 
      When a designer goes to use a button, I want that button to match 1:1 with code. When a developer is implementing the same button, the handoff and build should be frictionless. Most of our Figma components include implementation tips and tricks as well as direct links to the documentation site.

      <span>
        Just one of over 45+ organized component pages in Figma today; each has its own nested components and scaffolding, so in reality, there are over 200 components in the system (and that's not counting variants)
      </span>
    </ProjectMedia>
    <p>Not every designer has coding experience, and equally so, not every developer has design experience. We built our own CSS utility classes on top of Tailwind, allowing developers to quickly tack on modifiers to elements.</p>
    <p>Speaking of modifiers, aside from a few smaller sizes, we've typically used multiples of eight for spacing, padding, and margins—these all correlate to t-shirt sizes. One of the huge unlocks was when Figma introduced the ability to encode variables. 
      This is especially useful for newer team members who may not be familiar with the system, but are still able to leverage the variables and then communicate their intent to the developer. It helps everyone speak the same language—and not one that includes static values (e.g. 24px).
    </p>

    <span>
      We have variables set forth for spacing, including padding, margin and gap, border-radii, semantic color, thematic color, typography, and more
    </span>
  </ProjectMedia>
  <p>I've meticulously gone through the system in Figma, turning over every pixel, quite literally. Each component, whether it's an organism or underlying scaffolding, has been set up 
    with a variants, boolean properties, and usage guidelines—all in the name of helping designers (and in turn, developers) build faster.</p>
  <p>One designer in particular, reached out to me about the popover when we made updates in late 2024, “Btw, I am so jazzed about the new popover component and am using the hell out of the chip in design exploration! Love the composability, and I love how concise it is.” 
    Feedback like that fuels me, and over the past four years, I've made a significant number<FootnoteRef id="figma-updates" /> of updates to the system—all based on feedback from our designers.

    <span>
      This is a perfect example of composability within MDS, where the popover component is fed into the single select trigger, and matches our approach in code. Our consumers can then choose what type of popover they want, as well as the trigger
    </span>
  </ProjectMedia>
  <p>It's both wildly beautiful and slightly jarring to reflect on how much the system evolved over the past four years. 
    Although we began with a mildly jumbled mess of components, inconsistencies abound between code and design, it's just a reminder that starting somewhere—anywhere—is how you get somewhere else.

  Having saved 10.5 designers' worth of time from July 2024 to July 2025 is quite significant. The system is still heavily used today, and will continue to live on as a 
  testament to the power and importance of design systems.

    <p>Thoughtful motion is one of my core tenets. I care deeply about interaction design, however, I'm not a fan of motion design for motion's sake. There are sacrifices you make when you
      introduce motion—especially when it negatively impacts accessibility or load times.

      <p>One of my favorite examples of thoughtful motion was when marketing tapped on Rich and I to help them 
      with some concepts for our new marketing site. We put our heads together and came up with the above, perfectly illustrating how messy data is connected and comes together to tell a story. The culmination of this concept
      was an After Effects build by yours truly, leveraging my <a href="https://www.rowbyte.com/plexus">favorite particle system</a>, that helped me morph fluid data points into 84.51°'s degree symbol.

      A fluid interaction concept for the new login experience of 84.51° platforms. This never came to fruition, but was a fun exercise
    </span>
  </ProjectMedia>
<p>
  In another instance, I was tasked with enhancing our outdated login experience for 84.51° platforms. I looked to iOS and some of the interaction patterns there, especially how headings and text are often reused
  and animated between screens. 
</p>
<p>
  This is another case where I was able to leverage a combination of Figma's prototyping capabilities and Meridian's underlying design system with some slight modifications, to help tell the story.
  I am always cognizant of how a human might interact with an interface, so I oriented the motion entirely around the static location of the primary actions. While the wrapper height transitions from screen-to-screen,
  the actions remain mostly stationary.

</span>
</ProjectMedia>
<p>I'm glad the initial filter concept never came to fruition, for a couple reasons. When filtering content in tables, the user wants the table to load near instantaneously, but also expects the filters
to respond and function much the same. By animating and sliding in the selected values, it heavily increases the transition duration, as well as the width of filters. Imagine a world where the
table returns results faster than the filter finishes animating.
</p>
<p>
Where we landed was a much more instantaneous approach, with the filters quickly updating the selected content, and the table returning as fast as it possibly can. In the example above, the table 
is effectively narrowing down 250k+ campaigns into several thousand, in only a couple seconds.

      84.51° doesn't really have brand designers, at least, not in the traditional sense. A lot of times product identities, iconography, and even marketing materials would fall into the lap of 
      our Meridian team. Having a background in branding originally, I very much enjoyed leaning in and lending my expertise whenever the opportunity presented itself.

    I've designed roughly 80% of the marks for 84.51° products over eight years from 2017 to 2025. Though there have been a few that have been "sketched" by others, I always ensure consistency and prepare final files
    for the organization to use, whether that context is in product, marketing, or some internal use. I've partnered a lot with marketing over the years to ensure cohesiveness and consistency between the marks.
    A lot of this work is simply side-of-desk, but it's something I take pride in and it's not lost on me the impact it has across the organization.

  The 84.51° Bourbon Society (yes, that's a thing), just one of many self-organized employee groups, was doing a Barrel pick with a local distillery. They tapped on me to create what would ultimately be glass-etched into 
  the bottles. I crafted a badge that paid homage to our beautiful Cincinnati headquarters, referencing the distinct, sharp edges of the building.

  On another occasion, I was tasked with creating a badge for an insights certification. That quickly snowballed into an ask for the certificate itself, which I designed in collaboration
  with marketing. I care deeply about the details, as I spend time finessing type, hierarchy and structure. In this case, I rendered the certificate in 3D, with three different levels that effectively stack
  upon achievement. This was intended to be a LinkedIn-style badge that could be proudly displayed.
