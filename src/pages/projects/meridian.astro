Getting to watch you work and learn the design process from your perspective was such a privilege, and I feel like I always learned something new every time we paired on a project.”"

    </div>
    <p>After years of building products like <a href="/projects/stratum">Stratum</a> and its predecessors without a formal design system, 84.51° recognized the need for a unified design language in 2019. 
      This was the beginning of Meridian, the fabric of 84.51° products, a design system that would ensure cohesiveness, accessibility, and scalability across the entire ecosystem—both for designers and engineers alike.</p>
    <p>I reached out to my good friend and collaborator, <a href="https://richgustke.design">Rich Gustke</a>, in the hopes he would join 84.51° and help steward Meridian.
      As the system began to grow, I joined the team in early 2021, continuing to collaborate with Rich and our many developers. Rich and I would partner consistently; it was very much a shared ownership. 
      <p>I was responsible for upkeep of the Figma component library, creation of new components, system documentation, processes and measurement that would enable our teams to build better products faster.</p>
    <p>My biggest surprise? Over time, I fell in love with mentorship. I worked closely with many of our co-ops and interns, several of which would go on to become full-time designers at 84.51°<FootnoteRef id="mentorship" />. I found that I love sharing knowledge and fostering young designers' growth and learning.</p>
    <p>I'm insanely proud of the work we accomplished over four years: we instantiated countless new components and enhancements, shifted to a neater UI implementation approach with Svelte, and massively enhanced the MDS<FootnoteRef id="mds" /> Figma design system; the list goes on. And while the (incredible) Meridian team was formally disbanded in early 2025, the system still receives contributions and updates from various teams today.</p>
    <p>Our biggest claim to fame? With our components, we saved roughly 6.1 engineers' worth of time in 2024 alone—that's not even counting the time saved by our Figma design system!</p>

    <p>I'll admit it, I'm obsessed with Figma. I'm obsessed with making life easier for both designers and developers; keeping the Figma design system consistent and up-to-date with code is a big part of that. 
      When a designer needs to use a button, I want that button to match 1:1 with code. When a developer is implementing a design, the handoff and build should be frictionless. Many components include implementation tips and tricks as well as direct links to the documentation site.

    <p>Not every designer has coding experience, and equally so, not every developer has design experience. We built our own CSS utility classes on top of Tailwind, allowing developers to quickly tack on modifiers to elements.</p>
    <p>Speaking of modifiers, aside from a few smaller sizes, we've typically used multiples of eight for spacing, padding, and margins—these all correlate to t-shirt sizes. One of the huge unlocks was when Figma introduced the ability to encode variables. 
      This is especially useful for newer team members who may not be familiar with the system, but are still able to leverage the variables and then communicate their intent to the developer. It helps everyone speak the same language—and not one that includes static values (e.g. 24px).

      We have variables set forth for spacing, including padding, margin and gap, border-radii, semantic color, thematic color, typography, and more
    </span>
  </ProjectMedia>
  <p>I've meticulously gone through the system in Figma, turning over every pixel, quite literally. Each component, whether it's an organism or underlying scaffolding, has been set up 
    with a variants, boolean properties, and usage guidelines—all in the name of helping designers build faster.</p>
  <p>One designer in particular, reached out to me about the popover when we made updates in late 2024, “Btw, I am so jazzed about the new popover component and am using the hell out of the chip in design exploration! Love the composability, and I love how concise it is.” 
    Feedback like that fuels me, and over the past four years, I've made a significant number<FootnoteRef id="figma-updates" /> of updates to the system—all based on feedback from our designers.

    <span>
      This is a perfect example of composability within MDS, where the popover component is fed into the single select trigger, and matches our approach in code. Our consumers can then choose what type of popover they want, as well as the trigger
    </span>
  </ProjectMedia>
  <p>It's both wildly beautiful and slightly jarring to reflect on how much the system evolved over the past four years; proof you have to start somewhere. 
    Although we began with a mildly jumbled mess of components, inconsistencies abound between code and design, it's just a reminder that starting somewhere—anywhere—is how you get somewhere else.
