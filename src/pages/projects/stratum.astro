    <h2 class="project-heading"><span>Overview</span></h2>
    <p>Kroger was in the process of sunsetting their legacy analytics platform in 2017, and brought the build of the new platform in-house. 
      This was the beginning of what would eventually become Stratum, a robust analytics platform that has gone on to generate <strong>$1B+ in contracts</strong> for Kroger,
      and surface over <strong>3.8M+ reports</strong> for 84.51°'s CPG partners.<a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></p>
    <p>Until 2021, I had the pleasure of leading design Stratum, along a myriad of incredible people. 
      I was the lead UI designer, but equally responsible for discovery research, design systems (at a time when we didn't have one!), and visual
      design. It was truly a balancing act of parity and innovation—we had to meet existing needs of our users, while building with a forward-thinking mindset. </p>
    <p>It took months of vision workshops and hundreds of hours of research to align on what we were building, at a company that truly had not built bespoke products before.
      Despite the challenges, I'm deeply proud of what Stratum became. Let me start by showing you where we ended up—the latest exploratory work on Stratum AI—before diving into the full journey of how we got there.</p>

      <p class="project-subheading">Proof-of-concept, 2024</p>
    </div>
    <p>Imagine it's 2024, and everyone is talking about AI. I designed a proof-of-concept for a text-based AI, integrated neatly within Stratum to help users better navigate and take action on reports.</p>
    <p>I firmly believe in the power of storytelling, so this was a quick build to demonstrate how our Meridian Design System might be used to create a more engaging and intuitive experience.</p>
