I genuinely wouldn't be where I am today without your mentorship and guidance. Getting to watch you work and learn the design process from your perspective was such a privilege, and I feel like I always learned something new every time we paired on a project.”"

    <p>After years of building products like Stratum and its predecessors without a formal design system, 84.51° recognized the need for a unified design language in 2019. 
      This was the beginning of Meridian, the fabric of 84.51° products, a design system that would ensure cohesiveness, accessibility, and scalability across the entire ecosystem—both for designers and engineers alike.</p>
    <p>I reached out to my good friend and collaborator, <a href="https://richgustke.design">Rich Gustke</a>, to join 84.51° and help steward Meridian.
      As the system began to grow, I joined the team in early 2021, collaborating with Rich and our many developers. I was responsible for upkeep of the Figma component library, creation of new components, system documentation, processes and measurement that would enable our teams to build better products faster.</p>
    <p>Over time, I fell in love with mentorship. I worked closely with many of our co-ops and interns, several of which would go on to become full-time designers at 84.51°<FootnoteRef id="mentorship" />. I love helping designers grow, and sometimes I think I learn more than them!</p>
    <p>This project represents a significant evolution in how we approach design at 84.51°, moving from ad-hoc solutions to a systematic, scalable approach that benefits both our designers and the millions of users who interact with our products.</p>
